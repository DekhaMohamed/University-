      <p>The University of Wisconsin–Madison is a public land-grant research university in Madison, Wisconsin. Founded when Wisconsin achieved statehood in 1848, UW–Madison is the official state university of Wisconsin and the flagship campus of the University of Wisconsin System. It was the first public university established in Wisconsin and remains the oldest and largest public university in the state. It became a land-grant institution in 1866.[7] The 933-acre (378 ha) main campus, located on the shores of Lake Mendota, includes four National Historic Landmarks.[8] The university also owns and operates a National Historic Landmark, the 1,200-acre (486 ha) Madison Arboretum, located 4 miles (6.4 km) south of the main campus. </p>
